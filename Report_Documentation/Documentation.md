# CMPE322-OS-Scheduler

### Simulating a Preemptive Priority Scheduling
### Created by Halit Ã–zsoy - 2016400141

## Project Details

In summary, the objective was to create a process scheduling simulator for a one core/one cpu environment such that,

* It reads "definition.txt" to obtain the process unique names, paths, priorities and arrival times to simulate them.
* Then, it simulates running these processes which are defined as a couple of instructions.
    * List of instructions should be read from <program_name>.txt
    * Each instruction is defined as name and execution time.
    * Each program file includes a special instruction, `exit` which should finish the process.
* An instruction cannot be blocked by an interrupt but a process can be.
* Smaller priority number means higher priority.
* When two processes have the same priority number, their priority is decided in FCFS (First Come First Serve) order. 
* After each instruction, the next instruction of the highest priority process should be run.
* When a process with a higher priority then the current running process arrives, after current process' current instruction finishes, current state of the current process is saved and the new process is ran instead.
* Simulate running these processes and output program states when a change in ReadyQueue happens (a new process arrives/an old process finishes)
* Also, output analysis for each process in the end by calculating and outputting waiting and turnaround time of each process ordered by their arrival time.

## My Solution

I've taken an OOP approach, (although there're no extending classes or polymorphism but there're children&parent class objects)

I've created Classes which are responsible for only their tasks.

As a result, every object has its own responsibilities and their internal logic for completing these without interfering with each other's responsibilities.

## How To Compile

In order to compile this program you need `cmake` and `make` installed.

In a terminal, call commands:
```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
```
OR
```
cmake CMakeLists.txt && make
```
OR
```
chmod +x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```
By doing so, a executable called `cmpe_322_project_1` would be created

## How to Run Program
### Running with no arguments
It will read the `definition.txt` and code files in the current directory.
Thus, change directory to where the test case files exist and then call the program from that directory.
```
cd "Provided Files"
../cmpe_322_project_1
```
(Moving the executable also works)
```
mv cmpe_322_project_1 "Provided Files/"
cd "Provided Files"
./cmpe_322_project_1
```
When called with no arguments, it creates an output file called `output.txt` in the current directory.

### Running with one argument
The program also supports running with one argument that specifies the output file.
That path argument is relative to the current directory.
```
cd "Provided Files"
./cmpe_322_project_1 custom_output.txt
```

For testing purposes, if that argument is `stdout` it prints its output to terminal instead of writing to a file.
```
cd "Provided Files"
./cmpe_322_project_1 stdout
```

Also, the program can be run using the run script, `run.sh` in which it outputs `custom_output.txt` to the main directory.
```
chmod +x ./run.sh
./run.sh
```

## Testing with Provided Files
The project includes a test script which moves the original `output.txt` to `original_output.txt` in the `Provided Files` folder, runs the program there creating new `output.txt`

Then it uses `diff output.txt original_output.txt` in that folder and reporting if there are any differences or not.

Then, if there're no differences it deletes the new `output.txt` and moves `original_output.txt` back into `output.txt`

If there are any differences, it outputs the differences and moves the `output.txt` into `test_output.txt` in the main directory for further analysis. Also, it moves `original_output.txt` back into `output.txt`

The test script can be run as follows:

```
chmod +x ./test.sh
./test.sh
``` 

## The Platform I used
I've developed the project using `CLion 2018.2.6` on `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS`

It's developed in `C++11` so it needs to compile using that version. 

(Such configuration are written in `CMakeLists.txt` and it is automatically compiled with that version when compiled with `cmake` tool) 

The program is designed to be mainly used in linux environment, but since it is built with cmake it can be compiled and run in Windows/MacOS environments, too.

Also, I've changed the default `CMakeLists.txt` to increase it's readability, and lowered its minimum version and added extra flags to support older versions of `Linux`, `cmake` and `make`
